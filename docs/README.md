# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This guide serves as your entry point to understanding how OctoAcme runs projects, manages delivery, and coordinates teams to deliver customer value.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a **customer-first, iterative delivery** approach to project management. Our processes emphasize:

- **Customer value**: Prioritize features and improvements that directly benefit customers
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments frequently
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has designated Project Managers and Product Leads
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and adapt based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Foster an environment that encourages feedback and continuous learning

## Key Workflows

OctoAcme projects follow a structured lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and create a project one-pager
2. **Planning**: Define scope, resources, milestones, and dependencies
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, review, and iterate in short cycles
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and communicate changes
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings and identify improvements for future projects

Throughout this lifecycle, risk management and clear communication ensure alignment and rapid issue resolution.

## Roles & Personas

OctoAcme projects involve several key roles:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery activities, manages schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, write tests, and collaborate on design
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and ensure acceptance criteria are met
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

Each role has specific responsibilities and goals that contribute to successful project delivery.

## Communication Strategies

Effective communication keeps teams aligned and projects on track:

- **Weekly syncs**: PM and PdM alignment meetings
- **Standups**: Twice-weekly (or as agreed) team standups for coordination
- **Stakeholder updates**: Monthly progress reports to key stakeholders
- **Status reporting**: Weekly status updates covering progress, risks, and blockers
- **Ad-hoc escalations**: Clear escalation paths for urgent issues

We maintain a single source of truth for project status and use consistent communication templates.

## Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is built into every phase:

- **Acceptance criteria**: Clear, measurable criteria defined for every feature
- **Definition of Done**: Shared understanding of what "complete" means
- **Test coverage**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Code reviews**: Peer review process for all code changes
- **Continuous monitoring**: Observability and metrics to detect issues early
- **Retrospectives**: Regular reflection and process improvement
