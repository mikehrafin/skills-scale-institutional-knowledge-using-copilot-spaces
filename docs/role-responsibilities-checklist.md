# Role Responsibilities Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist helps project teams ensure that all critical roles are assigned, responsibilities are clear, and team members understand their accountabilities. Use this at project initiation and revisit during retrospectives to identify gaps or overlaps in role coverage.

## How to Use
1. Review the checklist at project kickoff with all team members
2. Assign specific individuals to each role (one person may hold multiple roles on smaller projects)
3. Ensure each team member understands their responsibilities and key interactions
4. Revisit quarterly or when team composition changes
5. Update as needed when confusion arises about accountability

## Verification Questions

Before proceeding with the project, ensure the team can answer:

1. **Who has final say on feature prioritization?** → _Product Owner_
2. **Who do developers go to with technical questions?** → _Technical Lead_
3. **Who removes blockers and facilitates process improvements?** → _Scrum Master_
4. **Who validates that business requirements are met?** → _Business Analyst / Product Owner_
5. **Who ensures quality standards and test coverage?** → _QA Lead_
6. **Who manages project timeline and coordinates communications?** → _Project Manager_
7. **Who represents stakeholder interests and gathers feedback?** → _Stakeholder Liaison_

If any of these questions cannot be clearly answered, revisit role assignments before starting work.
